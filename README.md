# Call-Center-Dashboard
Hello data community !
📊 Here is a dashboard l have created for a telecom client as a part of a Virtual Internship on Power BI from PwC Switzerland in the Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience offered by Forage !🚀

🔗 Dataset source : Forage, PwC Switzerland

▶️Task 1: Examine the transparency through KPI's and insights into Call Center Data Trends and Analysis of a telecom company for the first quarter of the year.

💠The primary aim of this analysis is to provide valuable insights into the following areas:
🗝️Customer Satisfaction Trends: Analyze and visualize overall customer satisfaction over time to understand how it has evolved.
🗝️Call Handling Performance: Examine key call center metrics, including the total number of calls answered and the number of abandoned calls by callers.
🗝️Agent Activity by Time: Gain insights into the number of calls handled by calling agents during different time intervals.
🗝️Response Time Efficiency: Evaluate the average speed at which incoming calls are answered to ensure prompt service.
🗝️Agent Performance Quadrant: Use a performance quadrant to assess agents' effectiveness by comparing their average handle time (talk duration) to the number of calls they have successfully answered.
🗝️Call Issue Analysis: Investigate the topics or issues discussed during calls to identify common themes and areas requiring attention.
🗝️Resolution Rate: Track the number of resolved calls to gauge the effectiveness of issue resolution efforts.

📌These insights collectively provide a comprehensive view of call
center operations and customer interactions, enabling data-driven
decision-making for improved performance and customer satisfaction.

🔗The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• Power BI Desktop - Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• Power Query - Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• Data Modeling - Relationships established among tables to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
• File Format - -pbix for development and -png for dashboard previews
